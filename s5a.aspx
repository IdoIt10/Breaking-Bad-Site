         After Gus’s death, Walter, Jesse, and Mike start a new meth business. When their accomplice Todd kills a child witness during their theft of methylamine, Jesse and Mike sell their share to Declan, another distributor. 
<br/>Walter produces meth for Declan, and Gus' former associate Lydia starts distribution in Europe, which is so successful that Walter earns US$80 million, which he buries on the Tohajiilee Indian Reservation.
<br/> Hank attempts to prove Walter is Heisenberg. Walter kills Mike when he demands his share of the money and hires Jack's gang to kill Mike's associates and Jesse. The gang turns on Walter, kills Hank, captures Jesse, and takes most of Walter's money.
<br/> Walter uses the remainder to escape to New Hampshire.
