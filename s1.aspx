        Walter, diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer, conspires with Jesse to cook methamphetamine ("meth") as a way to pay for his treatment and provide financial security for his family.
        <br />Jesse secures a recreational vehicle to cook in, while Walter devises a production route using unregulated chemicals, creating a highly pure product tinted blue. After a run-in with the Mexican drug cartel,
        <br />Walter adopts the name "Heisenberg", with his "blue sky" meth his signature product. Hank and the DEA become aware of this new figure in the drug trade and begin their investigation.
