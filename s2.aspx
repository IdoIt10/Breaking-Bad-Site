        Jesse's dealers become unsafe, and Walter hires a corrupt lawyer Saul to connect them to a high-profile drug dealer Gus as a buyer for their latest batch.
            <br />Jesse dates his apartment manager Jane, and she relapses on heroin. Jesse becomes unreliable. Walter refuses to pay him his half of the sale to Gus, but Jane blackmails Walter.
            <br /> Walter returns to Jesse to apologize, but allows an unconscious Jane to choke on her own vomit. With Jesse in rehab, Walter seems content until he witnesses a midair collision of two planes, a result of Jane's father, an air-traffic controller, becoming distraught over her death while on the job.
