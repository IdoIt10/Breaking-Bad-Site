         <br />Gus offers Walter a job cooking meth at a hidden lab. Walter demands Jesse to be his assistant rather than Gus' choice of Gale. Skyler learns of Walter's meth cooking and demands a divorce.
            <br />Hank's investigation leads him to Jesse, but he finds no evidence and assaults Jesse, forcing him into a short leave. Hank is forewarned about an attack from two assassins, and kills them but he becomes paralyzed in the aftermath.
            <br />Jesse's behavior becomes erratic, and Gus replaces him with Gale. Later, Walter fears Gus will kill him and Jesse once Gale learns enough about their methods, and instructs Jesse to kill Gale.
