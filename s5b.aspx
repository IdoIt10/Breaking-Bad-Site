After months in hiding, Walter intends to surrender, but changes course after Elliott and Gretchen minimize his involvement in starting Gray Matter.
<br/> He leaves his money in a trust which Elliott and Gretchen would administer for his children. He confesses to Skyler that he manufactured methamphetamine for his own satisfaction rather than his family's financial security.
<br/> At Jack's compound, Walter kills Jack and the rest of his gang with a remote controlled machine gun and frees the imprisoned Jesse, who kills Todd. Wounded in the aftermath, he asks Jesse to kill him, but Jesse refuses. 
<br/>The two share a farewell glance, after which Jesse escapes. Walter reminisces in Jack's meth lab and eventually dies.
